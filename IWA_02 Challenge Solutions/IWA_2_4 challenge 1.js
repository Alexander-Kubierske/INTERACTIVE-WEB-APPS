/* This is the firstname of the user */

const user = 'John'


/* This is the lastname of the user */ 

const surname = ' Smith' 


console.log(user + surname)



/* This is the firstname of the user /*

const user = 'John'


/* This is the lastname of the user /* const surname = 'Smith'


console.log(user; surname;)

to create a solution we needed to:
1. modify line 15 to have the asterisk before the backslash to complete the first comment
2. do the same thing in the middle of line 20
3. put the const surname = 'Smith' on a new line
4. add a space in 'Smith' to ' Smith' to output the full name separately 
5. remove the (;) from line 23 and add a (+) between user and surname

technically steps 3 and 4 are not necessary but make the code neater.

the problems were mostly associated with incorrect use of comments and some syntax errors in the console.log command
