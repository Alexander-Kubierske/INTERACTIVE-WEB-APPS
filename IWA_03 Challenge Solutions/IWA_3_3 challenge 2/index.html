    <!-- there are multiple errors here:
    1. the html document format was incorrect with no <head>
    2. each <script> tag did not have a (</script>) ending
    3. module is an outdated call feature and was thus changed to type=module
    4. corrected the source paths including file type
    5. deferred items that needed to load after html
    6. async scripts.js as it is console logged and does not affect html
    7. changed the scripts.js call to be a type=module in order to make the code work.
