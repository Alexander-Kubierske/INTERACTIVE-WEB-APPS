// here we have multiple errors:
// 1. the const tag is not in {}
// 2. the word from is misspelled as form
// 3. we need to actually specify the location of configuration thus giving the relative path ./ and declaring it as a .js file type
// we can also solve this problem by importing the configuration.js file instead of importing/exporting each item
